MUSICSIMILARITY_GENRE_GROUPS
	EN	Genre groups

MUSICSIMILARITY_GENRE_GROUPS_DESC
	EN	Define a list of genre groups. When filtering by genre only similar tracks within a track's genre group will be used. (If a track is not in a group, then only similar tracks that are also not in a group will be used.) Groups are configured as a semi-colon separated list of genre names (e.g. Pop; Dance) with each new group on a new line (empty lines are ignored).

MUSICSIMILARITY_IGNORE_GENRE

MUSICSIMILARITY_IGNORE_GENRE_DESC
	EN	Semi-colon separated list of artist names where genre's should be ignored - i.e. will match all genres.

MUSICSIMILARITY_GENRE_NO_MATCH_ADJUSTMENT
	EN	Genre no match adjustment

MUSICSIMILARITY_GENRE_NO_MATCH_ADJUSTMENT_DESC
	EN	Adjust a track's similarity score when it does not match the seed's genre, and is not in the same genre group as the seed. The higher the value the more different you make the similarity score.

MUSICSIMILARITY_GENRE_GROUP_MATCH_ADJUSTMENT
	EN	Genre group match adjustment

MUSICSIMILARITY_GENRE_GROUP_MATCH_ADJUSTMENT_DESC
	EN	Adjust a track's similarity score when it does not match the seed's genre, but is in the same genre group as the seed. The higher the value the more different you make the similarity score.

MUSICSIMILARITY_GENRE_NOTE
	EN	Music similarity is based upon the tonal attributes of a track. However, to aid with this genres may also be used, and you can configure this behaviour below. You may create 'genre groups' to indicate that genres are releated (e.g. 'Hard Rock' and 'Rock'). If you then enable filtering by genre, this will allow tracks with different genres but within the same group to be accepted. You may also aid the similarity score by setting values for 'Genre no match adjustment' (tracks that are of different genres, and not in the same genre group, will have their similarity score adjusted (a higher value implies more difference)), and 'Genre group match adjustment' (tracks are of a different genre, but are within the same genre group). If a track has a similarity score to another of (e.g.) 5 but it is not in the same genre group and 'Genre no match adjustment' is set to 15, then the actual score would be 20 - i.e. making it appear more dissimilar. This genre adjustment is applied regardless of whether 'Restrict genres' is enabled or not.

MUSICSIMILARITY_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLING
	EN	Attribute handling

MUSICSIMILARITY_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLING_NOTE
	EN	If you have analysed your tracks with Essentia, then this can be used to filter tracks based upon attributes (e.g. BPM, danceability, aggressiveness, etc.) and also for the similarity score. Setting both max BPM and attribute difference to their highest values will effectively disable attribute filtering.

MUSICSIMILARITY_MAX_BPM_DIFF
	EN	Max BPM difference

MUSICSIMILARITY_MAX_BPM_DIFF_DESC
	EN	Maximum difference in BPM between tracks.

MUSICSIMILARITY_MAX_ATTRIB_DIFF
	EN	Max attribute difference (%)

MUSICSIMILARITY_MAX_ATTRIB_DIFF_DESC
	EN	Maximum difference in attributes between tracks. Essentia gives a probability score for each attribute, this setting specifies the maximum difference in this score.

MUSICSIMILARITY_ATTRIB_WEIGHT
	EN	Similarity weighting

MUSICSIMILARITY_ATTRIB_WEIGHT_DESC
	EN	The similarity score between tracks can be calculated using only Musly (set weight to 0), only Essentia (set weight to 100), or a combination of both (with the weight here specifying the percentage of the scrore given to Essentia).
